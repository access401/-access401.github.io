Free Basic Scripts for the Zoom Conferencing Platform
Submitted by brianhartgen on Tue, 07/25/2017 - 08:57
These scripts for JAWS versions 16 onwards offer some functionality to support the Zoom conferencing software. They are not essential for using Zoom as the company have implemented accessibility to a high level. These scripts were developed for our own use and are delivered without any form of technical support. If they work for you, we very much hope you benefit from using them. If you have access to JAWS for Windows 2019 or 2020, you do not need to download these scripts as they are already included.

The scripts enhance the experience in a number of ways:

Many dialog box controls are easier to comprehend using speech and Braille.
When viewing a list of users, JAWS often "thought" it was in a menu when it was not. This was not specific to the scripts but even occurred with JAWS by default. We hope this is now corrected.
When in a meeting, press ALT+Windows+s to enable or disable the announcement of Alerts, such as when someone has left the meeting room. Note that with the free scripts alerts are only suppressed from within the Zoom client at this time.
Regardless of this, press ALT+Windows+A to hear the last alert, even if it was not spoken. This should enable you, for example, to ascertain whether someone has entered the room, but you are in control of that output. In July 2017, I wrote there is scope for refining which kind of alerts get spoken, but we're pretty sure the Zoom team will develop this functionality over time so these scripts will have a short shelf-life. Well, apparently they are still needed.
Press Insert+Tab to verify whether alerts are enabled or disabled.
ALT+R should report whether recording is enabled or not.
ALT+P should report whether recording has been paused or is resuming.
Regardless of the alert setting, ALT+A reports whether the audio is muted or unmuted. Note that this could take a couple of seconds.
Press Control+1 through to Control+0 to hear the 10 most recent chat messages. Press twice quickly to virtualise. Now available in the primary Zoom interface and in a meeting.
Press Control+F5 to enable or disable a special feature where only chat messages are output using Control+1 through to Control+0. If enabled, this will ensure that messages such as "You have muted the computer audio" are not spoken when using these keystrokes. Moreover people seem to drop in and out of meetings at an alarming rate, and if all you want to do is to flick through your chat messages then hearing other announcements is superfluous. Now available in the primary Zoom interface and in a meeting.
Press Insert+H for Hotkey Help.
What are the differences between the free scripts and those which you pay for?
There are a set of scripts for Zoom which are priced Â£30 or $42.
As of March 2020, these are the differences between the free scripts and those which you pay for.

Alerts sent by Zoom to the JAWS program can be suppressed globally, rather than just within the Zoom application itself.
There is considerable control over text chat message alerts. Select between hearing them automatically when they arrive or no automatic reading.
Keystrokes exist to place the content of the focused control into the JAWS Virtual Viewer for closer inspection and to display all messages in the current session.
Enable or disable a setting which advises if a person has raised a hand.
Press a keystroke to advise you who has raised a hand.
Press a keystroke to place a summary of your current settings into the JAWS virtual Viewer for closer inspection.
Press a keystroke to place a summary of the window title into the JAWS virtual Viewer for closer inspection.
Keystrokes exist to move to the text chat edit field and the history list.
A keystroke is available to bring all the Zoom default keystrokes into a vertical list. Activate any one of them by pressing Enter.
Support for Zoom Phone, for making and receiving telephone calls.
Other accessibility improvements.
Full documentation and technical support are included.
Updates will be made to the scripts as and when new features are requested.
A support Email list is available to all users.
